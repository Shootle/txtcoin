### Bay Bithack Project ###

### Bitcoin is the currency of the modern era. ###

People in under-banked and under-covered areas, however, can't take advantage
of Bitcoin's benefits. By providing a new method to send Bitcoin solely
through SMS, TxtCoin gives people in these areas greater financial freedom.

TxtCoin is built on Twilio, the Telephony API, to connect us with SMS-only
customers. Bitcoin is interfaced through the http://blockchain.info wallet API.
Data on the blockchain is queried with the http://blockcypher.com blockchain
API. The backend server is built on NodeJS using the ExpressJS web framework
and MongoDB.
